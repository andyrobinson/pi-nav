Experiments in GPS with Raspberry Pi. See pi folder for instructions on setting up PI.

## Notes on python-gps

There are lots of good articles on getting the adafruit GPS up and running, and example code:

<https://learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-ultimate-gps-on-the-raspberry-pi.pdf>
<http://www.danmandle.com/blog/getting-gpsd-to-work-with-python/>

but I couldn't find anything on the details of the python-gps interface.  This is based on investigation
and reading the source code.
