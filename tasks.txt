Epie - steering using servo

Current tasks
- hook up nav to helm
    - subtract min steer course time from time calculation to allow margin for error
    - deal with possible zero value for speed (overflow)
    - add debug logging to helm
- use an average speed rather than instantaneous speed
    - circular array
    - record array of gps data in sensors class
- TDD servo controller class
- integration test for navigator/helm
- test steering algorithm against different turn rates
- write servo simulator
- hook up and test simulator; make it easy to change the turn rate
- wire up real follower to helm and servo controller
- field test steering
