NOTE: need to reduce the rudder deflection when on course to prevent overcorrection.  The factor
should be calculated.

1. Ensure system can steer around a course_steerer
2. Fix simulation following rewrite to events
3. Implement a simple sailing algorithm:
    - only navigate to (max) half-way, then reassess
    - simple steer if not in the no-go area
    - decide once at beginning of navigation which way to tack even if
    a tack is not required (always choose more direct tack)
    - bear up to wind as much as possible if tacking
    - avoid the no-go area continuously by bearing off in the direction of the tack as needed
    - set sails according to the wind direction

Epic - field test
- Field test tracking including compass and windsensor
- field test steering without sailing

Epic - simulation
- Fix simulator
- Add wind and tides to simulation
- Add a bit of randomness to simulation

Epic - power-on self test
- Blinking red then green light
- Note that failure in self-check does NOT stop navigation from beginning

Epic - sailing
Current tasks
- Add avoiding no go - when changing course and while steering (bearing off)
- Add becalmed and in irons
- write an integration test for the sailing helm
- consider if we need to break out a bearing class to encapsulate the 360 behaviour of bearings (of course we do)
- decide what to do about changes or differences in wind direction during tack
- create class to control sail angle based on relative wind, use in the sailing helm
- plumb sailing helm into wiring
- move constants into config for sailing_helm and navigator
- field test

For later
- dealing with tides/currents/drift; probably need a compass (may need compass for rate of turn anyway)
- falling back when sensors fail (for instance tracking to compass and vice-versa)
- navigate to nearest next waypoint on reboot, NOT first in list
- software autoreboot
- hardware autoreboot (n.b. problems with self-check)

Done
Epic - steering using servo based on new event design
- Add logging to a different file to sensors

- Add avg heading and abs wind direction
