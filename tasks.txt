Epic - steering using servo

Current tasks
- multiple issues
    - in fake vehicle, write test and make check for rudder angle use abs - should now flip flop
    - seems to go too long before checking back with navigator - min time? But seems like other problem with Helm
    - need to reverse rudder angle to make steering work in Helm
    - the GPS or vehicle gets stuck in lost signal mode forever if GPS set to unreliable

- test steering algorithm against different turn rates
- field test steering
- set the rudder to position 0 on startup

For later
- use an average speed rather than instantaneous speed
    - circular array
    - record array of gps data in sensors class
