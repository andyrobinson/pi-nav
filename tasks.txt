Current tasks
- write servo simulator- IN PROGRESS
- hook up and test simulator; make it easy to change the turn rate
- test steering algorithm against different turn rates
- field test steering
- set the rudder to position 0 on startup

For later
- use an average speed rather than instantaneous speed
    - circular array
    - record array of gps data in sensors class
