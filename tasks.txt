Epic - steering using servo
- Add avg heading and abs wind direction
- Finish helm with turn and steady
- Add logging to a different file to sensors
- Fix tracking mode
Add power-on self test
- Field test tracking including compass and windsensor
- field test steering - need a set of local waypoints

Epic - simulation
- Fix simulator
- Add wind and tides to simulation
- Add a bit of randomness to simulation

Epic - sailing
Current tasks
- Add avoiding no go - when changing course and while steering (bearing off)
- Add becalmed and in irons
- write an integration test for the sailing helm
- consider if we need to break out a bearing class to encapsulate the 360 behaviour of bearings (of course we do)
- decide what to do about changes or differences in wind direction during tack
- create class to control sail angle based on relative wind, use in the sailing helm
- plumb sailing helm into wiring
- move constants into config for sailing_helm and navigator

For later
- dealing with tides/currents/drift; probably need a compass (may need compass for rate of turn anyway)
