Epic - steering using servo
- field test steering - need a set of local waypoints

Epic - sailing
Current tasks
- make sure that Course Steerer gives the helm a bearing between 0 and 360 to steer
- write an integration test for the sailing helm
- consider if we need to break out a bearing class to encapsulate the 360 behaviour of bearings (of course we do)
- decide what to do about changes or differences in wind direction during tack
    - use thw lower level heml steer method (yippee)
- create class to control sail angle based on relative wind, use in the sailing helm
- plumb sailing helm into wiring
- update sensors to include both relative (to boat) and absolute wind directions - adjust absolute for speed - think I need wind speed to do this
- move constants into config for sailing_helm and navigator

For later
- get a wind sensor and attach to PI
- use an average speed rather than instantaneous speed
    - circular array
    - record array of gps data in sensors class
- dealing with tides/currents/drift; probably need a compass (may need compass for rate of turn anyway)
